# Neue Fische - Notes and Documentation

This respository is meant to be my own documentation of the Neue Fische Web Dev Bootcamp.

It will include:

    - handouts,
    - challenges,
    - cheat sheets,
    - and my own notes and/or miscellaneous.

For a start, its structure will be topic-wise. E.g., I have no summarized all contents of the first week in a folder called "Basics: Markdown, Shell, and GitHub". I find the topic-wise structure much more convenient for my own purposes than the chronological structure of the hh-wevb-23-3 repository.

Finally, because we all like some fun, here is my favorite, if not "signature", GIF:
